  "summary": "All six requested frontend requirements for Meta Quest 3S support appear to be implemented: Quest-specific UI guidance was added to the Downloads panel and build instructions overlay; runtime Quest/Android detection was introduced and used to adjust messaging; VR-friendly CSS adjustments were added; and index.html now includes an appropriate viewport meta tag. A couple of extra, non-requested documentation/state-tracking changes were also introduced.",
