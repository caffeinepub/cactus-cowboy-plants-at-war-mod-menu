  "summary": "Diff implements a new laptop-style browser page with URL bar, Go/Enter navigation, back/forward history, and reload via iframe key; updates app shell branding (HTML title + manifest) and introduces a coherent “graphite” theme via CSS/Tailwind. No clear evidence in the diff that VR/auth/mod-menu flows are still part of the primary UI, since App now renders BrowserPage directly.",
